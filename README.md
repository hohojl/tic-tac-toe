# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple tic tac toe game. Where one player is x and the other is an o. The player who connects with three o's or x's wins the game. Player turns alternate on click.
Each square can only be clicked on once (it cannot be reassigned to another player).
When a row or a column or a diaganal is filled with marks from a single player, that player wins.
If the game board is filled with no win, then it is considered a draw.
